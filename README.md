## Should you trust news? A user centric approach to news curation

This is a web-based news aggregator which is developed in a user-centric approach.
The core motivation behind this project is to provide a platform for users where they are in control of the news they are exposed to. Additionally, they can verify the credibility of the news based on transparent and clear bylines describing the credentials of the news source and relvant attributes.

The application is deployed as a survey for a project in HAI. Link will be released after the completion of the closed survey.
